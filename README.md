# 42 Piscine

This is all my notes and code for exercises during the 42 school piscine (selection month).

It covers everything that was possible to be done, from linux basics, C compilation, writing basic code, IO, variables, conditionals, loops, arguments, makefiles, header files, string manipulation, small algorithms, linked lists, pointers, function pointers.

you can also find extra exercises like all the rushes 00-02 and the BSQ project
